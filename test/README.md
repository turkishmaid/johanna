# Tests

Maybe it's difficult to test, maybe I am too unexperienced 
to write good tests, maybe I'm just to lazy. 

However, here are two little programs you might want to use
when developing `johanna`.

## charlotte.py

Minimal program using `johanna` in batch mode, like you
would use for code you execute from Jankins or cron.

## icharlotte.py

Minimal program using `johanna` in interactive mode, like 
when you use `johanna`-enabled code from Jupyter Notebooks.
